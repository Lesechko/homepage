									<h2>Résumé</h2>
									<p>
										&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the
										presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more successful
										than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross
										Perot isn't successful like me. Romney &mdash; I have a
										Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers
										and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest &mdash; and
										you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure,
										it's not your fault.

								<li>
									<p><em>2017</em></p>
									<p>Became 45th president of the United States</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>2016</em></p>
									<p>
										Won election race with 77 votes more than Clinton,
										yippe-kee-yay!
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>2015</em></p>
									<p>
										Became the most important Republican nominating for
										presidential election run
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>2009</em></p>
									<p>Changed my mind and became Republican again</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>2005</em></p>
									<p>
										Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan
										Spitalny: no grades, certificates and other bureaucracy,
										but program offered courses in real estate, asset
										management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98%
										students gave positive reviews while studying, however
										some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against
										Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
										million to settle that...
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>2002</em></p>
									<p>
										Acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated
										and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue. I sure do
										like my surname!
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>2001</em></p>
									<p>
										Completed Trump World Tower and joined the Democratic
										Party
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1999</em></p>
									<p>
										Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have
										18 of them now in USA and abroad! Also switched to the
										Reform Party that year
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1997</em></p>
									<p>
										Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River,
										which was named Trump Place. Me and the other investors
										sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the
										biggest residential sale in the history of New York City
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1996</em></p>
									<p>
										Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a
										vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street. After
										an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the
										Trump Building
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1994</em></p>
									<p>
										Refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus
										Circle, turned it into a 44-story luxury property known as
										Trump International Hotel and Tower
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1989 ― 1992</em></p>
									<p>

										waste of money, I had to sell it, now it is American
										Airlines Shuttle, btw
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1988</em></p>
									<p>
										Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million,
										invested $50 million to restore the building and boosted
										it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the
										Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash in 1995)
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1987</em></p>
									<p>Registered as a Republican</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1985</em></p>
									<p>
										I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it
										into a private club.You can join if you pay $200K
										initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for
										members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I
										also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana
										became a manager, because she is another Trump!
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>1983</em></p>
									<p>
										I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football
										team. I changed team's play schedule and filed an
										antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League,
										so NJG are not doing so good now, but back then they were
										great!
